# Reflection: Version Control Using Git and GitHub

In this assignment, I used Git and GitHub to manage my data analytics project titled **fda22**. I initialized a local Git repository, made structured commits, and pushed the project to a public GitHub repository. 

Version control helped me:
- Track changes to my files over time
- Maintain clean and reproducible workflows
- Collaborate easily in case of team projects

Using commands like `git status`, `git log`, and `git push`, I learned how each part of the workflow connects local work to a remote repository. I also added a `.gitignore` file to prevent unwanted files from being tracked.

This process improved my understanding of reproducibility and traceability in analytics workflows. Going forward, I will use GitHub for all my analytics projects to ensure organized version management.
